This image extends the official elasticsearch image by adding the Marvel Sense plugin. This will get you a system ready to use with the [ElasticSearch Getting Started Guide](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current).

With Marvel Sense installed you can access it using a URL like:

    http://192.168.1.216:9200/_plugin/marvel/sense/index.html
    
(replacing the IP address shown here with your Docker host's)
